I. Instalation
 1. Unzip all of the files onto your computer
 2. Make a folder in your Calc called "kirby"
 3. Send the files using the graph link to your calc, if you "retain the folder" they will go in to the kirby folder. If not put the files in to the "kirby" folder.
 4. Now you can run the demo by starting the program call "dream" in the "kirby" folder.

II. Kirby's Dreamland 2 Demo is a very short demo version of the GameBoy counterpart . I got the game and loved it so much that I had to make it myself.

III. In the near future I hope to at least finish the first world. The graphics for the levels could use improvement, but that is a minor detail for TI- 89 basic.

IV. I would like to thank my friend A.T. for giving me the game. Without it I would have never got the idea.
