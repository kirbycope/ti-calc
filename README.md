A backup of TI calculator games and apps I made as a kid. I seem to have lost some projects due to GeoCities and Tripod shutting down long ago.

## The Crowning Achievement of My TI Development
"[DBZ - Sayin Saga Part One](https://github.com/kirbycope/ti-calc/tree/master/89p/dbzsayin1)" was included in the TiCalc.Org CD that shipped with the [TI Connectivity Kit](https://education.ti.com/en/products/accessories/connectivity-kit) in the early 2000s.
