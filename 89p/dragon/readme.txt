II. All if not most of the files beginning with db were created by downloading an image online then converting it to .bmp using IfranView (which I downloaded from CNET.com). Then I played with it untill there were distinct points (light->white and dark->black) then saved it as monochrome .bmp ,if you try this make the image small enough to fit on you TI- 89 using IfranView before you convert it, and then I used 89iview to import the monochrome .bmp and save it as *.89i. Yet the pics that don't start with db were (with the exception of ps2logo.89i, radiz.89i, and chichi.89i) hand drawn by myslef.

III. These images were made for my game that is a tentative project ( I work on it when I feel like, but I need help, suggestions, etc...).

IV. I would like to thank TiCalc.org for their message boards and anyone who will send me thier two cents about TI stuff I have made.
