# TI-89 Basic Apps

## Background
Back in 8th grade I took Alegbra 1. I had a TI-89 that my mom's friend had used in college and didn't need anymore. One day I was at my friend's uncle's house and didn't know anyone and was bored off my rocker. My buddy handed me his TI-92 Plus and showed me the code editor. He showed me the logic loops his dad had just taught him. The rest of 8th and 9th grade I spent typing each character out on the calculator and programming during class and lunch breaks. I uploaded most of my code to [TiCalc.org](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/52/5205.html) not all of it survived though.

## Apps I Remember Writing
* MIDIS (c. ~2000)
  * The first app I wrote and it would solve for the middle-point of a line. From there it grew to cover all equations I used in Allegbra 1 and it showed the work (printing each calculation it was doing and the result). My teacher saw me using it and when I showed him the code he said something like, "you understand the equation well enough to code it."
* DBZ Saiyan Saga (c. Jun 2001)
  * My buddy showed me code for an explosion which was drawing a circle and basically undrawing it using formulas. He had shown us a line game where "rats" would race using a RNG and we would bet on with would win. I had taken to doodling on the graph using the tiny crosshair tool and drew the fight between Goku, Piccolo, and Raditz. Naturally the lines became energy blasts and the circles became the impact explosions. I used some DBZ Pics (below) for the intro/story segment.

  * Included on the [CD](https://archive.org/details/ticalc-org-cd) shipped with the [TI Connectivity Kit](https://education.ti.com/en/products/accessories/connectivity-kit)
* DBZ Pics (c. Jun 2001)
  * I found some pictures online and edited them using [IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com/). I then used [89IVIEW+](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/72/7261.html) that let me convert images to TI-89 screen size and format (.89i).

* TI-89 GameShark (c. Jul 2001)
  * I found a pretty fun RPG that was another TI-89 game. The thing is TI-89 variables are accessable via `VAR-LINK` and any running program. Apps can lock or archive them but it's a command away from being unrestricted and then changed (to give max health).

* Kirby's Dream Land 2 (c. Aug 2001)
  * I experimented with moving a character around the screen and looping pictures to make animations.

* Final Fantasy 89 (c. Apr 2002)
  * I made a game based on a fanfic I wrote for FF7. It had a working overworld, leveling through combat, and interactive menus.
