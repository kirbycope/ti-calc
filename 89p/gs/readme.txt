VI. Future Plans

I. 
 1. Unzip all of the files onto your computer
 2. Make a folder in your Calc called "gameshk"
 3. Send the files using the graph link to your calc, if you "retain the folder" they will go in to the  "gameshk" folder. If not put the files in to the  "gameshk" folder.

II. I used 89iview to creat the logo and all the rest of the graphics and code was done by me.

III. I had the idea to make a GS for the TI- 89 after I barely beat FF7- Cloud's Quest.

IV. I would like to thank TiCalc.org for their message boards, Geocities for hosting my site, and anyone who will send me thier two cents about TI stuff I have made.

V. If you have any comments, suggestions, death threats, or would like to help in some way please e-mail me at kirbycopejr@yahoo.com or go to www.geocities.com/kirbycopejr
